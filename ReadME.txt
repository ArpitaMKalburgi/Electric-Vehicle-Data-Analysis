This repository contains an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the United States. It breaks down vehicle counts by type (BEV, PHEV), state, manufacturer, model year, and more. The dashboard aims to make the data more accessible for analysis, policy insight, and strategic planning.
